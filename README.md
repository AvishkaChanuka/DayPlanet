# DayPlanet
 The Day Planet is a web-based social platform designed to encourage and track activities related  to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The platform allows users to post  their daily or special activities that contribute to one or more of the SDGs, review others' posts by  assigning relevant SDG icons, and share sustainable tips. With gamification elements such as  leaderboards, progress bars, and badges, the platform aims to foster a global community focused  on making small, yet impactful, contributions towards sustainability.
